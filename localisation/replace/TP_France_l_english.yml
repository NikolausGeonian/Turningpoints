Unfortunately, his people never welcome him, there were only few Centrists expressed their support to him and that was also soon lost due to his inaction in the face of a disjointed political situation. \n Jean III showed disgust at the status quo and had left Paris for Algiers to enjoy the beach and sun of North Africa."
