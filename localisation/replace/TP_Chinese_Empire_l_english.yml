#china.2.t:0 "Our Efforts Since The Last Century"
#china.2.d:0 "After the Second Opium War following extreme humiliation with several unequal treaties, the majority of the ruling elite now argued that in order to strengthen themselves against the West, it would be necessary to learn Western technology and adopt their military armaments. Some members of scholarly class of China submitted folds to the imperial government, which includes setting reform direction and implementing the constitutional monarchy. However, most of the group of eight regents who had been appointed before the Emperor I Ju (As known as Xianfeng Emperor) died opposed the reform and wanted to isolate young emperor from previous empress, which made Cixi decided to conspire with court officials and imperial relatives to seize the power, and the coup was supported by reformist officials.\nEmpress Dowager Cixi give strong support to those reformist, who used to be her allies, and ensured The Self-Strengthening Movement sustained which caused The interpretation of Confucian teaching was also radically altered, turning sharply toward pragmatic approaches to governance. The Self-Strengthening Movement succeeded in securing the revival of the dynasty from the brink of eradication.\n After an arduous war with France for the sovereignty of Vietnam and defeating Japan in the first Sino-Japanese War, Chinese Empire started join the Power’s game and became allies with German and Austria. \nWhen Kaiser Franz Joseph I was assassinated by Serbian terrorist, Chinese Empire irrevocably joined the Great War against Russian, French Indochina and British Raj, and helped the Central Powers defeated Tsardom won the peace with honor."

#china.3.t:0 "Power struggle between the Junta"
#china.3.d:0 "However, after the outbreak of the Great War, the situation turned sharply. The anti-war Tang Shaoyi cabinet which turn against this war was forced to resign. Marshal Yuan Shikai was recommended as the Prime Minister by Advisory Council and began the "Junta period" for nearly 20 years.\nAt first, under the ardent enthusiasm of the war, the people had a good impression on the Junta's coming to power. It was in this mood that the bureaucracy was rapidly militarized and the country made great strides toward militarism. When the Great War became the inevitable seesaw battle, especially in the mountains of Myanmar and madid valley of Brahmaputra River(Yarlung Tsangpo River), the patience of the subjects finally came to an end. After Lu Jung-t'ing's idioticpolicy of draft law in Liangkwang was promulgated, the riots were ignited in Kwangchow Wan and the revolution of the Naamjyut Gungsei (Canton Commune) finally broke out.\nAlthough after several months of the little civil war, the socialist were weakened, the rest of the revolutionary forces had to silencing and the seeds of rebel have been buried. \nIn the last days of the war, Marshal Yuan Shikai came to the end of his life. After he died his political legacy was soon divided up by the officers. Because of the lack of a prestige to control this huge military system, the struggles of the various tribes in Peking around the supreme power have not been terminated. Both Feng Kuo-chang and Ts'ao K'un had tried to approach the supreme power, but in the end they were all defeated by Wu P'ei-fu."
#china.3.a:0 "Such a crowd of moron."
#china.99.t:0 "Overcast Days"
#china.99.d:0 "Ironically, the infighting of the Junta brought about a free market environment. When the military budget was guaranteed, those soldiers have no intention to intervene the economy. In this10 years since the socialist’s unrealistic dream fell through (1920-1929), economy has been fully developed. Until 1933, with the inexplicable collapse of the German stock market, with the response of the international market to the German financial crisis, the economic situation of the empire has fallen into an unprecedented dilemma.\nEven if the emperor came forward and put the government under tutelage, problems has long been piled up for a long time."
