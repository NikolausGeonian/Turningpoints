worldnews.1.d:0 "[GetNewsHeadline]King George V passed away last night. The King's life is moving peacefully towards its close since five days ago and now rest in peace.\n\nKing George V ascended the throne as king-emperor upon the death of his father in 1910. During his reign, as the result of the Great War, the empire of his cousin Nicholas II of Russia fell, while the British Empire kept germans away from British Isles through the "Peace with Honor". However, the broke-up of Empire accelerated after the Statute of Westminster in 1927.\n\nNow his controversial heir, Prince of Wales Edward is ready to take the sovereignty and so far it's hard to say whether it was a disaster or not."
